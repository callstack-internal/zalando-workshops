# React Native Performance Workshops

> A comprehensive React Native workshop focused on performance optimization techniques, profiling tools, and regression testing

## 🎯 Overview

This workshop teaches React Native performance optimization through hands-on exercises using a book browsing app. You'll learn to identify bottlenecks, implement optimizations, and prevent performance regressions using industry-standard tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. React Native environment set up - please follow the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide from the official docs
2. Cloned repository
- Please install dependencies the dependencies: `npm install`
- use `npm run start`
- use `npm run android`
- use `npm run ios`
- verify the app opens properly on both platforms
4. Flashlight installed: https://docs.flashlight.dev/#installation
5. Maestro installed: https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro-docs/blob/main/getting-started/installing-maestro/README.md

## 🔧 Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm start                    # Start Metro bundler
npm run ios                  # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android              # Run on Android emulator/device
npm run lint                 # ESLint code checking
npm run lint:timing          # ESLint code checking with timing
npm test                     # Run Jest tests
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
npm run test:perf:baseline   # Establish performance baselines
npm run test:perf           # Run performance tests and compare
npm run test:perf:check-stability # Verify test stability
```

### Build & Profiling
```bash
npm run bundle:android       # Create production Android bundle
npm run bundle:ios          # Create production iOS bundle
npm run bundle:discover     # Run bundle analyzer
npm run downloadtrace:android # Download Android performance traces
```
